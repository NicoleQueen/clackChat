## Demo

Write your original intention, philosophy, and goals for the project what you design. A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

## Installation

Explain some prerequisites that users need to prepare before installation and use, such as：You Need install or upgrade [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= `8.*`, Npm version >= `5.2.0`, [Yarn](https://www.jeffjade.com/2017/12/30/135-npm-vs-yarn-detial-memo/) preferred).

## Features

```bash
npm i
```

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance.

## Built with

```bash
npm start
```

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
